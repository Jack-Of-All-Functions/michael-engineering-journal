## Stand Up Notes

We discussed what we would be working on today. Our primary focus both individually and as a group is to read up on Postgres and maybe start designing our database schemas.

## Work Completed

- Updated API routes
- Updated readme to include descriptions and define usage of API routes
- Read a lot about PostgreSQL
- Implemented a basic script with PostgreSQL and Node.js to create 1,000,000 random entries in a table

## Lessons Learned

One of my big blockers for the day was using async/await. I kept getting an error telling me that await could only be used within an async function. I understood that to mean that await must be used *in conjunction* with an async function, as opposed to *inside of* an async function. This was a big learning moment for me, and hopefully a mistake that I won't repeat again.

What not to do:

```
const someFunction = () => {
  const result = await somePromise();
  return result;
};
```

What **to** do:

```
const someFunction = await () => {
  const result = await somePromise();
  return result;
};
```

This was a major thorn in my side today, but it's an easy enough fix now that I understand the problem.
